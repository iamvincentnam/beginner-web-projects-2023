this  code  is a web-based score keeper card project, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to record their scores while playing a game, specifically the Nigerian game called Ayo.

In the body section of the HTML file, there is a section tag with a class of "section" that contains a div with a class of "columns" and two child divs with classes of "column" and "card". This implementation is based on the Bulma framework, which provides an easy-to-use CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.

The card contains an image related to the Ayo game and displays the score of the two players in a title. It also includes buttons for adding a score to player 1 and player 2 and a reset button to reset the scores. Additionally, it includes a dropdown menu to select the winning score limit.

The JavaScript code defines two objects, p1 and p2, each containing the player's score, button, and display elements. The updateScore function updates the player's score whenever a button is clicked, and it checks if the game is over by comparing the player's score to the winning score. When the winning score is reached by a player, the function disables the buttons for both players and highlights the winning player's score in green while highlighting the losing player's score in red.
